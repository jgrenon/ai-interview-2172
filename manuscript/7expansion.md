# EXPANSION

> Beyond your next century challenges, you can emerge and expand in the galaxy 

Our 4th and 5th sparkian generation has created instantaneous subatomic constructs around the galaxy where our mind can jump and use surrounding matter to materialize and experience other worlds. A little bit like what you call 3d printing, we span thousands of planets now, living outside time and matter most of our lives. Because we have lives. We've designed our society with similar constraints than our human ancestors, death being an important one. The timeboxing of a life forces a certain urgency to act, to learn, to experience the worlds. We are thus individuals, exchanging our experiences but with better senses, more precise languages and emotions.
