# Unbiased

> Cognitive biases are hidden everywhere and we need to uncover them. 

science has been designed around time and order. inherited observations from your point of view and conscious or subconscious religious lenses. chemistry is a good example. continuum of state with labels at specific attractors. abstractions are good to learn, but can be deceitful if you use them as building blocks for new discovery. accumulating error can steer us away from the reality. 

talk about time as our bias. How our science is focused on finite state, specific moments instead of thinking about processes and the rules of transformation. talk about chaos theory as start, but not applied enough in all areas of science. 

talk about universe evolution and the creationist bias when you’re talking about the laws of the universe. laws imply a creator as they can’t emerge from chaos by themselves. while there are some convergence or quasi-stable state called attractors in chaos theory, they are never permanent and give enough time, they will change and get disrupted. You used to think that everything was created, now you’ve made progress but there are still inherited biases that affect the questions you’re asking and thus the responses you get.
