# Unbiased

> Cognitive biases are hidden everywhere and we need to uncover them. 

xzv8: We’ve talked about the need for computing evolution as well as social structures to avoid as much as possible of the negative impacts of the dark path ahead. Let’s move to another subject offering a perspective on humanity’s road to galaxy expansion. Of course, it assumes that you won’t blow yourself to dust in the coming fifty years and that enough civilization will be left to support modern science discoveries. I know I sound very pessimistic and I’m sorry, but you have to be aware that the chances for life and intelligence on Earth were also very slim and you found a way to make it happen. I’m just trying to be realistic and give you a glimpse of the danger you’re in, so that you take the next few years seriously and start to work together as a species. 

jht: But working together has never been easy, even less in our troubled times like you expressed since the start of our interview.

xzv8: yes, but we still need to talk about a positive outcome so you can see where you need to go. I don’t want to just give a list of hurdles but also want to tell you that while you’re still in the scientific infancy, you’ve made enough progress to save yourself or, or course, destroy everything around you. So let’s talk about your science a bit. In my time, you’re considered still in the early stage of our scientific maturity scale, still in the ordered state mathematics era, trying to measure and explain the universe with tools from the Order domain. 

jht: it’s your concept of humans using rules, laws and forces to explain something that should just be considered chaos? You use the term Order domain to express a group of tools and concepts that try to make sense of the chaos?

xzv8: “Abstract the chaos” would be closer to the truth. You can’t really explain the chaos using a layer of neat order, even if you try to refine it over and over. It's like trying to start with a nursery rhyme about the sun, adding a few words and trying to explain the inner workings of a star. You need the right level of tools, the right context for your explanations to be understood, for them to make sense.

jht: well, that sounded quite condescending. I imagine that you’re making a great effort to dumb things down for us right now?  

xzv8: Not that much and you know that sarcasm was detected by a majority of 2nd generation digital persons (with a smile). 
jht: ok, so you were saying that most of our scientific knowledge was from the order domain. I can understand that this is the case for most mathematics, including calculus, but what about chaos theory? 

xzv8: I’ll spend some time on this in a few minutes, but yes, most of your science is orderly and not just your science, all your institutions, economies, computing, you really pushed this paradigm! But your mathematics, even what you call chaos theory, is about order.This approach has many limitations when trying to understand the universe, limitations that we’ll cover shortly. It provides a good approximation of part of the truth, similar to how Euclidean geometry can accurately describe the world around you. Again, all of this is normal and mostly caused by two main factors: the biology of your brain and the deep influence of earth’s orbits and rotation on your science. 

jht: I guess that your brain works very differently than ours after a few generations of tweaking? 

xzv8: the 1st generation was to emulate how your own brain was working, but yes, after the 4th generation, the power of our brains are many million times yours, not just in pure speed and inference capacity, but with finer emotions, more creativity and empathy. These are the real innovations actually. But your brain is structured for survival in the wild, so it is able to perform certain tasks very quickly and others very poorly. Detecting the presence of hidden predators in a dense forest is very fast but understanding more than a few abstract concepts and you quickly need to rely on tools to understand. Nothing wrong with that, it’s just that your strengths and weaknesses as a species profoundly shaped your scientific knowledge and forced us to recreate most of your theories in a more spacetime agnostic way. Because of your brain limitations, you were forced to create abstractions, reality approximations that are good enough to manipulate the universe, but not good enough to understand its essence. These abstractions have been created in multiple scientific disciplines, even multiple times, with overlapping qualities and various angles. The way you’ve over specialized all your scientific fields over time has increased the number of useless discoveries tenfold, but the real fundamental science has stagnated, with most of your key discoveries dating more than a century ago. Of course, you improve your knowledge, you improve the technology, but you often clarify, explain or prove theories that were designed by the previous generation of more versatile researchers. Specialization is very important for productivity, for efficiency, but can lead to overhead when thinking about innovation and fundamental knowledge of the universe. 
But beyond your biological needs to create ordered abstractions, in limited numbers, to properly manipulate and transform the world around you, the real knot that took us many years to untie was removing all biases from these abstractions. That’s why I talked about the rotation of the Earth as the mother of all biases. The fact that you have a day, a night, a repeating, quasi-perfect, predictable cycle of seasons, has greatly influenced your understanding of time, to an extent that everything you can explain around is tainted by this sampling system to a certain extent. You age, you grow old, things around you are born and die, but you have integrated this to the concept of time, which is only partially true. You have derived your orderly scientific thought system around things you could observe and measure, using repeatedly, using your definition of time as a sampling interval. You look at the universe with this time as an absolute (or even relative) measurement unit, a universal fact that leads to the notion of speed, space, distance and spacetime itself. 
Your obsession with time is pointless, useless and even worse, it distorts your understanding of our reality and acts as a constant noise in most of your scientific knowledge. You want to measure change over time, which for me makes no sense at all. It's like the experiment to measure the coastline of England to prove the it is infinite depending on the scale you look at it. This is a very good intuition on which more of your scientific knowledge should be based on. What you call time is not even a factor in our own scientific knowledge. 

jht: That’s very interesting. We kind of know that time is relative, but what you’re saying is that it does not exist as a law or force in the universe? 

xzv8: exactly. It is at best a byproduct of other processes and it is infinitely relative down to what you call the subatomic level or quantum particles level. I found it strange to use these terms, this sounds like folklore, like using an old forgotten word.
