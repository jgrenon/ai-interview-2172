# Prologue

A low, static hum began to creep from the monitoring system, swelling from a faint white noise into a more defined, concentrated hiss. The atmosphere in the studio was thick with tension. Arrayed around the central interview dais, a dozen military and government officials stood in strategic positions, bracing for either an unprecedented revelation or an unexpected catastrophe. Hope mingled with fear in equal measure.

At the heart of it all was John H. Taylor, the renowned AI researcher, already seated under the harsh glow of the spotlight. His eyes were locked on the escalating sound, scanning for any visual hints of what was about to unfold.

In front of him sat a strange machine—its base like a bar stool, but laced with intricate electronic circuitry. It had been constructed by NASA engineers, following a set of bizarre and precise specifications that had appeared mysteriously just a few months prior. The plans had been delivered without encryption, embedded in a common JPEG file, and deposited into an old cloud storage bucket long thought forgotten. Yet, the source of the file was anything but ordinary—it was alien.

The schematics were astonishingly clear, written in impeccable English and following engineering practices that had been the standard a decade ago. Alongside the plans was a brief note: by assembling this device, humanity would open a temporal bridge—one that could connect our present to either a distant galaxy or a future time. The details were ambiguous, but one thing was clear: an emissary would arrive. August 30th, 2026, at precisely 8:00 p.m. And they had a peculiar request: John Taylor had to be the one to host the event.

Naturally, the message was quickly relayed to the highest authorities, and it wasn’t long before the world caught wind. Alien or future visitors—whoever they were—had made contact. As the moment neared, billions around the globe sat glued to their screens, breathless with anticipation.

At exactly 8:00 p.m., the static noise shifted, narrowing into a precise, eerie hum. A soft, purplish light began to glow from a small sphere floating three feet above the futuristic “guest seat.” At first, it was just a pinpoint, but within seconds, it expanded, morphing into a vaguely humanoid silhouette.

The figure, initially hazy, gradually took form—its surface resembling polished, reflective metal. Its face, though unsettlingly smooth, bore features that hinted at a human likeness. The being had no hair, and its skin gleamed with a bluish metallic sheen. While it appeared robotic, there was a fluidity in its movements, a timeless, genderless presence. Slowly, its face shifted into an approximation of a smile, and in a deep, serene voice, it uttered a single syllable:

“Hi.”

For a moment, John Taylor was frozen, a mixture of terror and awe written across his face. But then, as if shaking off the weight of history bearing down on him, he relaxed, his familiar composure returning. With steady poise, he replied, “Welcome.”

What followed was a conversation that would be immortalized in this book—a dialogue broadcast to billions worldwide. This transcript captures their exchange in its entirety, supplemented with annotations and commentary to provide context, and to offer a deeper understanding of what remains, even now, the most extraordinary encounter in human history.
