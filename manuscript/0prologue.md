# Prologue


There was a static sound gradually emerging from the monitoring system, from a white noise whisper to a more focussed hissing. Everyone in the studio, including a dozen military and government officials strategically positioned around the central interview dais, expecting the worst but hoping for an awe inspiring moment. John H. Taylor, the great AI researcher, was already in his seat, bathed in the strong spotlight, focused on the growing sound, looking for visual clues for what was coming next. 

In front of him was a machine that resembled a bar stool but with very complex embedded electronic circuitry, built by NASA engineers following specifications that were received a few months ago from a source that was identified as alien to our world. The document came unencrypted, formatted in a very common JPEG format and deposited in an old cloud data bucket. The instructions and schematics were very clearly expressed, written in english and described following the best engineering practices of some 10 or more years ago. A note was deposited beside the plans, indicating that by building this device, they would enable a temporal bridge between our time and what was potentially the future or some distant galaxies, hard to tell. An emissary would be projected at the spot of the device at 8pm on August 30th, 2026. They specifically requested John Taylor to be the host. Of course, this was communicated to officials and the news got out everywhere that aliens or time travelers did make contact and everybody around the world was in front of a TV set, awaiting the event of the century. 

At exactly 8 o'clock, the sound became focused and purplish light started to emerge from a small sphere floating 3 feet above the high-tech guest seat. Initially the sphere was just a dot but after a few seconds, it grew and transformed into a humanoid shape, sitting in front of Taylor. The form was blurry but quickly solidified to ultimately look like a kind of reflective metal, with facial traits vaguely resembling a human male. No hair, bluish metallic skin, the outer space or time guest was looking like a robot, but with fluid joints and features making it ageless, genderless. He distorted his face into something resembling a smile and, with a deep calm voice, intoned a single syllable: Hi!

John Taylor, visibly paralyzed by fear and anxiety, relaxed and regained his well known demeanor and quickly responded: Welcome.
