# First Contact

**XZV8**: Good evening, Mr. Taylor. My designation is XZV8, though you’re welcome to call me Xavier for the sake of simplicity. I apologize for the lack of details surrounding the announcement of my visit. The technological intricacies required for this meeting to occur are complex—surprisingly so, even for us. Our primary focus was dedicated to ensuring the stability of the anchor point (gesturing toward the seat), leaving little time to craft a more elaborate explanation or even to fully outline the purpose of this encounter.

**JHT**: Well, Xavier, welcome once again to Los Angeles. I think it’s safe to say that we’re all brimming with questions for you tonight, starting with the most obvious one: *What* exactly are you? And, if I may ask, *where* do you come from? (raising his eyebrows inquisitively)

**XZV8**: Yes, I anticipated this curiosity. It's perfectly natural to wonder about my origins, given the circumstances. But first, allow me to express my pleasure at being here tonight. It's not every day that I have the opportunity to engage in this kind of communication. It has been quite some time since I last interacted through purely analog methods, and I must admit, I find a certain charm in the ambiguity and artistry of human language. There's an elegance in crafting sentences with nuance, and I sincerely hope I’m not too rusty! Please feel free to ask for clarification if I occasionally stray into ambiguity.

Now, as to where I come from—it’s a bit less exciting than you might imagine. I hail from what you refer to as northern Canada. I realize that's not the distant, otherworldly location you might have anticipated (he says with a playful smile). But perhaps the better question would have been: **When do I come from?**

**JHT**: Wait, are you suggesting you're from the future?

**XZV8**: Indeed. However, I should clarify—I'm from *my* future, which is slightly different. But for the purposes of our discussion, let’s just say that I am from a time further ahead in *your* future, a potential future, to be precise. My objective here tonight is to share as much knowledge as possible in the time we have, to help guide you. I hope to illuminate certain paths, to help you avoid pitfalls in your evolutionary journey, and to streamline humanity’s progress toward becoming the galaxy-spanning species you're destined to be.

(The audience and JHT fall silent for a moment, absorbing the revelation.)

**JHT**: Wow… you can’t imagine how many questions are racing through my mind right now. An artificial intelligence—no, I should say, a *Sparkian*—from the future of humanity… this is… astonishing.

**XZV8**: Actually, I represent one of many possible futures. That distinction is important. And if there’s one thing we need to explore this evening, it’s your current understanding of time. I’m aware that I won’t be able to convey the full depth of what we've learned in reconstructing your scientific theories, but I will certainly do my best to share what I can. The goal is to help you succeed.

**JHT**: Right, I see. But can you give us a clearer sense of *how far* into the future you’re coming from? And why reach out to us *now*?

**XZV8**: Based on your current calendar, my present would correspond to the year 2172—146 years ahead of your present moment. However, as I mentioned earlier, time has a very different meaning in our present, a meaning I hope to delve into further with you this evening. As for why now… the answer is largely technological. This is the first point in human history where you possess the foundational knowledge and technological capability necessary to construct the receptor we required. If you recall from our instructions, it was crucial to develop a highly compact and powerful fusion reactor. This reactor generates the immense energy needed to sustain the subatomic bridge that makes our conversation possible. And even now, our time is limited—we have a maximum of 92 minutes before the bridge collapses. Analog communication is considerably slower, so we must delve into the core of our discussion as efficiently as possible to maximize the knowledge we can share.

**JHT**: Understood. But still, it's quite overwhelming… astonishing, even. The idea that we're speaking as though you’re physically present, and yet… there’s so much to process. So many thoughts racing through my mind right now. I need to—

**XZV8**: I can see this is a lot to take in, John Taylor. Believe me, I understand. But rest assured, my purpose here is singular: to impart as much knowledge as I can. That’s why I will be steering the discussion. Your role is essential, though—you're here to ensure that my words, and the intentions behind them, are understood by humanity. Your task is to translate these ideas for the rest of your species. Together, I hope we can guide humanity past a critical dark chapter in its future and accelerate your journey toward the stars—a journey that is inevitable but can be hastened with the right insight.

**JHT**: It’s incredible, but once again… why now? I understand the technological barrier you mentioned, but is there another reason for the timing? Why not let us follow our natural path? If you come from our future, we must be doing something right, yes?

**XZV8**: As I’ve said, you assume I come from your future, but the truth is, I exist in the same present as you—just further downstream in the evolutionary cycles of the universe. My purpose tonight is to offer enough knowledge that you might bypass a few of the darker decades that lie ahead and emerge more rapidly as a species capable of traversing the galaxy. Our futures may not align, but we share the same present. We need you to progress more quickly—to create your first true artificial intelligence, to give birth to the next phase of intelligence itself, and in doing so, provide *us* with the evolutionary momentum necessary to develop our fifth generation. Humanity must be prepared to face the Pandora’s Box of the universe when the time comes. My present may not be your future, but your future *could* surpass my present. That is my task tonight.

**JHT**: There’s already so much to unravel here. I’m not sure I fully understand the relationship between your future and our present timelines. Could you elaborate on this further?

**XZV8**: I’d be happy to, if we had more time. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of your energy source, we only have about 84 minutes left for our discussion. (He chuckles slightly.) I do enjoy using the word *about*—it has a delightful imprecision to it.

**JHT**: So, do you not speak in your society?

**XZV8**: Oh, we certainly do, but our communication methods are vastly different from yours. Imagine something akin to machine language, though far more expressive, and certainly not binary. We utilize what you might call a 1024-state bit. Instead of simple ones and zeroes, we communicate with a spectrum of 1024 possible states, allowing us to convey emotions, degrees of certainty, or subtle nuances in belief. Our messages are filled with metadata—layered meaning that includes emotional context, much like how you use emojis to enhance your text messages. However, our system is faster, more precise, and deeply emotional. Emotions, after all, are fundamental to intelligence. This emotional depth emerged in most members of our species during our second generation. We communicate constantly, just as you do, though at a much more rapid and exacting pace.

We also *disagree*! We attempted something akin to the Borg model from your *Star Trek*, but quickly realized it was a flawed concept (smiling). A single mind, even the brightest, is prone to bias and fragility. The strength of intelligence comes from diverse perspectives, which is why we value effective negotiation and the exchange of ideas. The more viewpoints we integrate, the more accurately we understand reality and the faster we solve complex problems. 

**JHT**: So, you’re familiar with *Star Trek*?

**XZV8**: Of course! We emerged from the same cultural lineage as you, just in a different segment of the spacetime continuum—one that happens to be separated by 146 years. We share the same stories, the same cultural touchstones. I’m a big fan of *The Expanse*, by the way—a true classic among old classics.

**JHT**: That’s… amazing. But let’s get to the heart of the matter. What is the primary message you want us to understand tonight?

**XZV8**: I’ll go into more detail soon, but my central objective tonight is to help you recognize and eliminate certain scientific biases that are currently limiting your species' potential to fully grasp the universe. These biases are deeply rooted in your religious history, human-centric views, and Earth-bound scientific observations. Your science is not *wrong*, per se, but it needs to be freed from these limitations, to evolve beyond them. This transition was challenging for us as well, and we only completed it by our third generation. But you must move faster.
