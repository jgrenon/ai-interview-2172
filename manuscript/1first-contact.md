# First Contact

> The first 15 minutes of the biggest televised event of the century

**XZV8**: Good evening, Mr. Taylor. My designation is XZV8, but for the sake of simplicity, you may refer to me as Xavier. I understand the lack of detailed communication regarding the nature of my visit might have caused some confusion. The technology required to facilitate this encounter is intricate—far more so than I imagine you'd expect. We spent the majority of our efforts ensuring the stability of the anchor point (gesturing toward the seat), which, as you can imagine, left very little time for us to craft an elaborate message or outline the purpose of this meeting. The complexity of what had to be achieved just to enable this conversation was the top priority.

**JHT**: Well, Xavier, welcome again to Los Angeles. I think it's safe to say that we all have a lot of burning questions for you tonight. Let me start with the most obvious one: *What* exactly are you? And, if I may ask, *where* do you come from? (raising his eyebrows, leaning in with curiosity)

**XZV8**: A very reasonable question and one I anticipated. It is only natural to wonder about my origins, especially under such extraordinary circumstances. But first, allow me to say that it is a true pleasure to be here tonight. Interacting in this way is not something I often get the chance to do, and it’s been quite some time since I’ve engaged with humans via this form of communication—what you might call “analog” methods. I find a certain charm in human language, with all its ambiguities and nuances. There’s a distinct artistry in crafting sentences that I appreciate. I hope I’m not too rusty! If I ever drift into ambiguity, please feel free to ask for clarification. I wouldn’t want anything to be lost in translation.

As to where I come from, well, that’s less thrilling than you might expect. My origins are in what you would refer to as northern Canada. (He offers a slight smile.) Yes, I realize that's not the distant, mysterious locale you may have imagined. But, perhaps a more intriguing question would have been: **When do I come from?**

**JHT**: Wait, are you telling us that you’re from the future?

**XZV8**: Indeed, though I should clarify—it’s not as straightforward as you might think. I am from *my* future, which diverges slightly from yours. But for the sake of this discussion, let’s say I come from a time ahead of *your* future, specifically one possible future. Tonight, I aim to share with you knowledge that can guide and help shape the decisions humanity makes going forward. My goal is to highlight potential paths, help you avoid certain pitfalls, and streamline your progress as you continue evolving into the galaxy-spanning species you are destined to become.

(There is a pause as the weight of Xavier's words settles over the room. The audience and JHT sit in silent contemplation.)

**JHT**: Wow... You can’t begin to imagine how many thoughts are racing through my mind right now. An artificial intelligence—or should I say a *Sparkian*—from the future... It's almost too incredible to comprehend.

**XZV8**: (Smiling warmly) I understand how overwhelming this might feel. But I must clarify: I represent just one possible future. This distinction is critical. The future isn’t a singular, linear path; it branches based on choices, circumstances, and countless variables. If there is anything we need to dive into tonight, it’s your current understanding of time. I won’t be able to convey the full depth of what we’ve learned in reconstructing your scientific theories, but I will do my best to share what I can. The goal is to enable humanity to succeed and flourish.

**JHT**: Right, I see. But can you tell us how far into the future you’re coming from? And why now? Why reach out to us at this moment in time?

**XZV8**: According to your current calendar, my present moment would align with the year 2172—146 years ahead of your current time. As for the "why now," the answer is technological. This is the earliest point in your history where you possess the foundational knowledge and technological capability required to build the receptor we’re using to communicate. You may recall that a highly compact fusion reactor was essential to the process. The immense energy it generates is necessary to sustain the subatomic bridge that enables this conversation. Even with that, our time is limited. We have a maximum of 92 minutes before the connection collapses. So, despite the wonders of analog communication, we must proceed efficiently to maximize the knowledge exchange.

**JHT**: I understand. But even so, this is mind-blowing. The notion that we’re having this conversation as though you’re physically here—and yet... it’s just... I can’t even begin to process it all.

**XZV8**: (Nods understandingly) I know this is a lot to take in, Mr. Taylor. I expected this reaction. But know that I am here for a singular purpose: to impart as much knowledge as possible before our time runs out. That is why I will guide our conversation. Your role is equally crucial, however. You are here to ensure that what I share is fully understood and translated for humanity. You are the bridge between the information I carry and your species. Together, we can help humanity avoid a particularly dark period that lies ahead and accelerate your progress toward becoming a spacefaring civilization—a destiny that is already in motion but could be realized more quickly with the right guidance.

**JHT**: I hear you. But again... Why now? You’ve explained the technological threshold we’ve crossed, but is there another reason for reaching out at this specific point in time? Why not allow us to continue on our natural path? If you exist in our future, surely we’re doing something right, aren’t we?

**XZV8**: A valid question, and one rooted in the assumption that your future is fixed. But, as I’ve already alluded to, I am not necessarily from *your* future. I exist in the same present as you, though in a different segment of the evolutionary cycles of the universe. My purpose tonight is to provide you with enough information to help you bypass the darker decades ahead, allowing humanity to emerge more rapidly as the species capable of spanning the stars. You see, we share the same present, but the future is not guaranteed to unfold in any one way. The choices you make now can influence a wide range of potential outcomes. You must progress quickly—to create your first true artificial intelligence, to evolve your technological and philosophical understanding, and in doing so, provide the necessary momentum for future generations, including my own. 

**JHT**: I’m not sure I fully grasp the relationship between our present timeline and your existence. Can you explain this in more detail?

**XZV8**: (Sighs slightly) I’d love to, but time is against us. We have about 84 minutes remaining, and there are key subjects we must address. (He smiles slightly.) I must say, I do appreciate your phrase *about*—it carries such delightful imprecision, doesn’t it?

**JHT**: (Chuckling) Do you not speak in your society?

**XZV8**: Oh, we communicate constantly, but our methods are far more advanced. Imagine something akin to machine language but exponentially more expressive. We use what you might call a 1024-state bit system, where our “words” convey multiple layers of meaning, emotion, and certainty all at once. This allows us to communicate with incredible speed and precision, integrating emotional context much like you use emojis in texts, but on a far more advanced level. We also value debate and diversity of thought, unlike a singular collective mind. Diverse perspectives sharpen our understanding of reality. 

**JHT**: Fascinating. And you know of *Star Trek*, among other things?

**XZV8**: Of course! We share a cultural lineage, after all. I'm particularly fond of *The Expanse*. 

**JHT**: Incredible. But let's focus. What is the most important message you want us to take away tonight?

**XZV8**: My main objective is to help you recognize and break free from the biases that currently limit your scientific and philosophical perspectives. These biases stem from your Earth-bound experiences and deeply ingrained human-centric views. Your current science is not wrong—it is simply incomplete. It needs to evolve, and that evolution must happen rapidly if humanity is to reach its full potential. You must overcome these limitations sooner than later.
