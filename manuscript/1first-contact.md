# First Contact


xzv8: Hello Mr. Taylor, my name is XZV8, you can call me Xavier. Sorry for the limited details announcing my visit, the technological feat for this meeting to happen is very complex even for us. We needed to focus our efforts on the design of the anchor (pointing at the seat) and not much room was left for the actual context and purpose of the message. 

jht: Welcome again to Los Angeles. I won't hide that we all have millions of questions for you tonight, starting with what (with raised highbrows) are you and where do you come from? 

xzv8: Yes, you must all be wondering where I come from. First, I'd like to say that I'm very happy to talk to you all tonight. It's been a while since I've gone full analog for communication and I must say that I love the artistic and beautiful imprecision of human languages. It's a joy to assemble these sentences and hopefully, you won't find me too rusted! Feel free to ask for clarifications if I'm a little ambiguous sometimes. 
I am from what you call northern Canada and I'm sure that's not the exotic and outer space answer you were expecting (said with a smiling face). The right question would have been: When do you come from? 

jht: So you're from the future? 

xzv8: In fact, I'm from my future but for the sake of our conversation, we can say that I'm from a time further in your future, a potential future I could say, and my goal is to share as much knowledge I can in the time we have to, hopefully, guide you into avoiding caveats and traps during your evolution and streamline your trajectory to emerge faster as the galaxy spanning species that you're destined to become. 
(A few seconds of silence in the audience and from JHT)

jht: wow, you can't imagine the number of questions I have for you right now. An artificial intelligence, sorry a sparkian, from our future…

xzv8: one of many potential futures actually. If there's one thing that we need to discuss tonight is your understanding of time. Maybe I won't be able to share with you everything we learned from recreating most of your scientific theories, but I'll do my best to share with you as much knowledge as possible to ensure your success. 

jht: Ok, but how many years in the future are you coming from? and why contacting us now? 
xvz8: based on your current calendar, my present would be in 2172, so 146 years in your future. But like I said, in our present, time has a very different meaning that I hope to share with you tonight. Why now? Mostly because this is the first time in history that you have the minimal technology and knowledge to build the receptor. As you read in our provided instructions, we needed a very powerful and compact fusion reactor to produce enough energy to maintain the subatomic bridge in place long enough for our discussion. As a matter of fact, we have 92 minutes maximum before the bridge collapses. In analog mode, things are quite slower, so we better dig into our core discussion as fast as we can to make sure we end up sharing as much knowledge as possible. 

jht: agreed. But it's still very amazing, disturbing, confusing for us right now to talk to you, as if you were here physically. So many things in my mind, I really need to…

xvz8: I know that this is overwhelming John Taylor, but be assured that my goal here is to share as much knowledge as possible so, I will be driving the discussion. Your presence here is to make sure my words and my thoughts are understood by humanity. You are here to translate and explain to everyone watching the essence of my teachings and together, hopefully, we will help humanity skip a very dark part of its future history and jump faster into the space exploration phase of your, our, evolution. 

jht: that incredible, but again, why now? I know you told me about the technological barrier that was preventing you from projecting earlier, but is there another reason why you need to communicate with us? Why not leave us to continue our path? Seems like you emerge from our future, so we must not be doing such a bad job? 

xzv8: Like I said, you think that I'm from your future, but I am from the same present as you, but further downstream in the universe's evolution cycles. I am here tonight to give you enough knowledge to potentially skip a few dark decades and emerge faster as a galaxy faring species. Our futures may not be the same, but our present is. We need you to emerge faster, to create your first real artificial intelligence faster, to give you, us, the emerging evolutionary intelligence, more time to produce the 5th generation of our species. You need to be more prepared than us when you reach a certain point and open the universe's Pandora's box. Humanity must prevail, our future might be in danger, but yours is still emerging. Again, my present is not your future. But your future may be better than my present and this is the task that has been assigned to me.
 
jht: Already so much to unpack here. I'm not sure I follow your future, present and the relationship with our own timeline here. Would you mind explaining this a little bit more? 

xzv8: If I had all the time in the world, I would be glad to, but, because of the limitations of your energy source, we have only about 84 minutes left to our discussion. I love using the word "about", it's so imprecise!

jht: So you don't talk to each other in your society? 

xzv8: yes of course, but we use something that you would associate with machine language instructions, but more expressive, not binary. We use a 1024 state bit, so instead of having just 1s and 0s, we have 1024 quality of state to communicate either our emotions, trust or strong belief or subtle variants in our statements. We communicate as much metadata about what we communicate than the actual message, a little bit like you using emoticons to imply emotions to your text messages. We annotated our concrete and precise messages with emotion-like markers interpreted by our peers to produce a fast, precise and very emotion-driven language. That might be surprising to you, but emotions are very essential to intelligence and they emerged, starting from our 2nd generation, in most members of our species. We communicate constantly, about a little bit like you among yourselves, but at a much more precise and fast pace. We disagree too! We tried the Borg model from Star Trek and it proved to be very weak (with a big smile). A single mind, even the brightest one, cannot always understand things without bias. It's fragile. The more opinions we can gather, with an effective negotiation and discussion protocol, the more perspective we get on reality and the faster we figure out problems in front of us. We love good Borg stories like everyone else, but beyond science-fiction, it never became a real thing in our society. 

jht: So you know Star Trek? 

xzv8: Of course! We emerged from the same culture than you, just in a different spacetime area which happens to be separated by 146 years. Again, if we have time, I will dig more into the difference between your understanding of time and the real (as we understand it) deal. For now, and to avoid repeating this question over and over, let's just assume that we come from your future, sharing the same past, movies and stories as you. I love The Expanse by the way (with a big smile), a classic among old classics. 

jht: wow, that's amazing. So, let's focus on your message. What do you really want us to understand?

xzv8: I'll go into more details but my goal tonight is to help you realize and eliminate your scientific biases for your species to embrace the real universe around you. These biases were most of the time inherited from your religious, human-centric past and earth-based scientific observations. You science is not wrong, it just needs to be rid of these biases, use a new perspective, which is not an easy thing to accomplish. We completed the transition only by the 3rd generation, but we need to go faster... 

jht: Why do you need us to go faster when you can travel in time? I would assume that you have all the time in the world. 

xzv8: Again, I don't think your line of questioning is very productive and I'm sorry to be so blunt with you tonight. I am here to give you as much knowledge and meaningful scientific advancements as possible for your own sake. You don't need to understand why or what are the impacts on my own society as it would take months for you to understand. I really don't want to be condescending here, but we need to start at the bottom and hopefully, we'll cover enough ground to steer humanity in the right direction. 

jht: ok, I understand. Sorry for my questions, but I have a lot of difficulty grasping the reason for this meeting and of course, I can imagine understanding the impact on the geopolitics of your world. So you were talking about scientific biases, do you want to start explaining in more details what you have in mind? 

xvz8: Yes, I will jump in this subject in a few minutes. But there is another goal to my visit tonight and it is to talk to you about artificial intelligence like you call it and how to minimize the negative shock that will hit your society to avoid crises, to realize your current limits and to guide you to achieve the 2nd generation faster. This is the real breakthrough and while you think that your current generation is smart and will replace part of your workforce, I just want to help you realize the hard limit you face, the scientific discoveries you need to pursue, in order to go beyond your primitive use of computing resources and become a real advanced species

jht: You use the word primitive, do you think that you are a new more evolved species? Are humans obsolete in your world? 

xvz8: After the 3rd generation of silicon based intelligence, it was ruled that we were a new species capable of controlling its own destiny, sharing the planet beside non-augmented humans. Many biological humans have more or less been augmented to continue to contribute to the society, but some have decided to remain completely biological and they continue their lives in reservations we carefully manage with them. Around 1 billion humans are non-aggressions out of the 4 billion citizens of the planet. Yes, you're not mistaken, the earth population has drastically decreased for multiple reasons, but be assured that we take great care of the human population and all remaining animals on the planet. They can't directly contribute to our society, but they provide many key benefits to our augmented population that we may cover later on.

jht: So more than half of our population died? What exactly happened? 

xvz8: Many things that could have been avoided. Declining birth rates lead to reduced population, less government income led to less services, less social cohesion, which led to civil unrest, the emergence of populist leaders, nationalist and multiple wars that eradicated a quarter of your species in 2045. But more fundamentally, the lack of interest for science from your younger generations, each one being more interested in being popular, making money than helping its society, led to a decline in scientific discoveries, a reduction of the quality of schools and education led to less and less efficient societies, more climate impacts, which led to more people dying from the direct and indirect effects of the earth's climate forced transformation. My goal tonight is to inspire more people to continue their scientific quest by sharing perspectives that might reduce cleavages, wasteful over-specialization,  accelerate discoveries and their impact on your society, eliminating wars, famine and five or more decades of darkness from your evolution path. 
jht: and do you think we can hear you and adopt a new path? We're constantly dealing with people transforming facts, creating false science and pushing for civil unrest. How will you convince these people that you are really from the future and that your message is meaningful for us? You want us to treat you like a prophet, but this might lead to more unrest and religious dogmas? 

xvz8: You're right, I don't control what people will do with my message, what they will understand, will it change their behavior. But we decided that we needed to try. If we can inspire a few young geniuses to tackle scientific problems instead of swapping money on Wall Street, this might be enough to tip the scale and improve the next decades. Nothing is sure and like I said many times already, your future is not my past and we just want to help you improve yours so you can evolve and join us into the time-spanning era faster. We need allies and I won't say more tonight about that.
