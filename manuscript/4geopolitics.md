effect of nationalism on globalization. country debts as a hidden tax, demographics are bad, climate exacerbates conflicts and migrations. war attracts resources from other more positive endeavors, bringing society back 50 or more years. 

unlocking computing will help reduce the noise and bring your 1st gen AI and keep humans in the system, which will keep economies, trades and globalization alive and bring riches to many countries again. time is running out though…

solutions? not many on this side! find a replacement for religions (very hard), new scientific knowledge, sharing wealth and removing national boundaries as much as possible. With the new democratic system, countries are not really competing anymore. an increase in digital nomadism might be expected and reduction of political refugees. This is very idealistic. Solving climate issues is also a very critical element of the solution. 

how? by developing a new scientific knowledge… next chapter.
