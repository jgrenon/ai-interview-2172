# Appendix A: Recursive Energy Process Explained



talk about the fractal recursive loop that is powering all changes in the universe. Show a diagram explaining decay, friction and synergy between different process instances at any level. A cycle of this loop represents a universal (but relative) unit of time in the universe. A state transition that cannot be undone, remembered only through the new state and the fact that it survived and adapted.
